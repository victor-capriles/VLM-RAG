This blue coloration is consistent across multiple viewing angles and lighting conditions shown in the context images. The shade appears to be a deep navy blue or royal blue, with some variations in saturation due to lighting conditions. The object's surface seems to have a matte finish rather than a glossy one, which affects how the blue color is perceived. When comparing to the similar images provided as context, I can see that this particular shade of blue is a recurring theme, suggesting this might be a standardized color for this type of object.", "error": null, "processing_time": 8.24}

The color temperature of the light has that characteristic golden hour quality that occurs approximately 1-2 hours before sunset. The context images show similar lighting patterns and shadow directions, which helps confirm this timing.
