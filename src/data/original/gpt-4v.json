The countertop is made up of two different segments. On the left, there's a wooden surface supported by a set of brown drawers, and on the right, a similar wooden countertop is propped up by a smaller cabinet.\n\nOn the left segment of the counter, you can see a few items scattered: a coffee maker near the center, a purple container next to it, and a cylindrical object that looks like a candle jar to the left of the coffee maker. Next to the coffee maker, there's a box of Swiffer Sweeper dry sweeping cloths.\n\nMoving to the right segment of the counter, there is what appears to be a closed silver laptop situated next to the Swiffer box. A couple more items are placed at the far edge of the right countertop: a small, wood-finish square box which could be a jewelry box or a small container, and a red decorative piece that resembles an abstract heart or candleholder.\n\nBeneath the right countertop, on the lower shelf of the small cabinet, a children's book is visible along with what looks to be a small toy or figure. The room has a moderately textured wall, painted in a neutral tone, which might be off-white or light gray.\n\nThe image is quite dark, with the light source coming from the upper left and not fully illuminating the entire space, leaving the features of the room and the items in a shadowy condition.",

Here's a general guide on how to bake a frozen apple pie that might be similar to the instructions you would find on a Marie Callender's box: \n\nPreheat your oven to 400\u00b0F (205\u00b0C).\nRemove the pie from the box and plastic wrapping. If there is a plastic cover or any additional wrapping on the pie itself, remove that as well.\nPlace the frozen pie on a baking sheet to catch any filling that may bubble over.\nCut slits in the top crust to allow steam to escape.\nBake for about 45-55 minutes or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbly.\nIf the edges of the pie start to brown too quickly, you can cover them with strips of aluminum foil to prevent burning.\nOnce baked, let the pie cool for at least 2 hours before serving to allow the filling to set.\nKeep in mind that these instructions are general and may not be specific to the Marie Callender's pie you have.

Clean the surfaces thoroughly with soap and water or a multipurpose cleaner to remove dirt and stains.

However, I can respond to your question about the shirt based on the image provided.\n\nThe shirt in the image features a pattern with various shades of brown and beige. There is a small amount of black as well, but it doesn't appear to be the dominant color in the pattern. The black areas are mostly present in the outlines or details of the leaves and floral patterns. Overall, it would not be described as having \"a lot\" of black when considering the entire color scheme of the shirt.",
