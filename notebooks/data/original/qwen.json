It does not contain any information about a shepherds pie or instructions for cooking it in a conventional oven. \r\n \r\n To make a shepherds pie in a conventional oven, you will need to follow these general steps:\r\n \r\n 1. Preheat your oven to the temperature specified in the recipe. This will depend on the recipe you are using, but it is usually between 375\u63b3F (190\u63b3C) and 425\u63b3F (220\u63b3C).\r\n \r\n 2. Prepare the filling by cooking the ground beef or lamb, onions, and garlic in a pan until browned. Add in the vegetables, such as carrots and peas, and cook until tender.\r\n \r\n 3. Mix the cooked filling with the mashed potatoes, and spread it into a baking dish.\r\n \r\n 4.
